# zkFold x Defy: Cross-border payment infra using ZK tech

Develop a cross-border banking payment channel leveraging Cardano network, Plutus smart contracts, and a ZK KYC verification protocol for emerging markets.

### Proposed solution

Existing financial service solutions in emerging markets do not truly understand and address underserved communities' unique challenges and varied needs. The problems include low digital literacy, high transaction costs, lack of compliance, privacy, and financial infrastructure, resulting in a financial inclusion gap.

Our solution introduces a Cardano Blockchain-based system for an affordable alternative to cross-border payment while adhering to regulatory standards. Using Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), our service can comply without compromising sensitive user information.

When a user undergoes KYC, we mint a token on Cardano with the hash of their data. The actual KYC data will be stored with the company (Defy Financial). The token proves that the KYC procedure was performed at a particular date and time. The KYC token helps track the evolution of the user’s KYC data.

We will create zero knowledge circuits based on real-world banking requirements. These circuits encode the requirements and enable the company to prove that the users’ KYC data satisfies those requirements.
